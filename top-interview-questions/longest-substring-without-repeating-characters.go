// This is a Go programming language implementation of a function called lengthOfLongestSubstring.
// This function takes a string s as input and returns an integer that represents the length of the
// longest substring without repeating characters in the input string.

// Here's how the function works:

// The function initializes three variables:
// left represents the left boundary of the current substring.
// right represents the right boundary of the current substring.
// maxLen represents the maximum length of a substring without repeating characters found so far.
// The function initializes a chars map to keep track of the characters in the current substring and their last seen positions.
// The function enters a loop that continues until the right boundary right reaches the end of the input string s.
// Inside the loop, the function checks
// if the character s[right] is already in the chars map by using the _ , ok := chars[s[right]] assignment.
// If the character s[right] is not in the chars map,
// it is added along with its position right. The right index is incremented,
// and the current length of the substring right-left is compared with the maximum length maxLen so far.
// If the current length is greater than maxLen, maxLen is updated.
// If the character s[right] is already in the chars map,
// the character at the left boundary s[left] is deleted from the map, and the left index is incremented.
// The loop continues from step 4.
// Once the loop completes, the function returns the maximum length of a substring without repeating characters found so far.
// The max function is a helper function used to calculate the maximum of two integers.
// It takes two integers a and b as input and returns the greater of the two integers.
// It is used in step 5 to update the maxLen variable.
